<h2>Compose environment</h2>


<p>We currently have the following working compose environments:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/dockerwest/compose-magento2">Magento 2</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/dockerwest/compose-pimcore">Pimcore 4 &amp; 5</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/dockerwest/compose-laravel">Laravel</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/dockerwest/compose-symfony">Symfony</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The goal of these compose environments, is to provide an easy, one-stop solution to get you started with these
    frameworks.
    They include a fully configured docker-compose.yml file and some <a href="/helper-commands">helper commands</a> to
    let you execute common commands inside docker containers (composer, nodejs, mysql,...)</p>
<p><strong>Docker developer dns</strong></p>
<p>Use <a href="https://github.com/BlackIkeEagle/docker-developer-dns">Docker developer dns</a> to easily access your
    environments without manually editing your hosts file.</p>
